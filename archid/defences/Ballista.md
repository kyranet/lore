Ballista (not to be confused with the [bolt thrower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballista)) is a rare high-yield class of weapons, and are typically used in:
- Ballista-class Warships
- [[Hexa 5|Hexa 5]]

Ballista is the successor of the [[Executioner|Executioner]] class, and uses phased energy that can disrupt enemy shield systems, cause short-circuits on electric systems, and quickly melt most alloys.

## Variants
Like most [[ArchId|ArchId]] weapons, the class comes in three variants:

- **Turret**: the smallest, with a hidden energy source, very short body and a muzzle between 40 and 50 metres.
- **Tower**: features a larger body and extra refining mechanisms that grant the weapon higher accuracy and lethality. Optionally, the *Ballista Tower* may also have extra energy sources.
- **Cannon**: features limited range and mobility, and trades speed for higher yield, the body is shorter and typically completely attached to a warship's body. In some cases, the *Ballista Cannon* may not be able to move.

Ballista is the predecessor of [[Naeria|Naeria]] and requires high quantities of LEP to fire, but can use SEP to increase the fire speed.

## First Appearance
The first appearance of Ballista happens very late in the story, during a relatively peaceful era of progress.
