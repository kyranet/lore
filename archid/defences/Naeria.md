Naeria is an unique class of high-yield super-weapons of mass destruction, they are very exclusive and are used in:
- Naeria-class Warships
- [[Energy Condensation Centre|Energy Condensation Centre]]

Naeria is the successor of the [[Ballista|Ballista]] class, and uses pure energy beams capable of instantly dissolving enemy shield systems as well as their hull and most defensive systems, earning the class the title of "one-shot weapon".

## Variants
Due to its super-weapon nature, the class comes in only two variants:

- **Turret**: powered by 1cm² of CSEP per shot, it hides a vast energy source underneath that creates the conditions required for the weapon to work. The muzzle is between 30 and 85 metres, depending on range and power requirements, and features a series of systems designed to create a stronger energy beam with each step, the mobility of this weapon is limited to 170º wide and 100º tall.
- **Cannon**: powered by 1cm² of HCSEP per shot, making it extremely powerful and expensive to run, it has a smaller energy source but requires CSEP instead to fire its systems. The muzzle is between 50 and 850 metres, depending on range and power requirements. similar to the *Naeria Turret*.

## First Appearance
The first appearance of Naeria happens during the Rise of Kal-71, very late in the story.
