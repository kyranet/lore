The Cyan (also called Cyan Ray) is a [[Nova|Novan]] defence megaproject unique for its size, its unique fire beam properties, and its energy source.

## Size and problems
The Cyan measures 75 km (46 mi) tall and has a cannon measuring 40 km (~25 mi) long and 3.5 km (~2.2 mi) wide, however, most of the tower is hidden underneath the ground, showing only the top 5 km (3.1 mi).

The original Cyan blueprints are of [[Xaminar]] origin and were retrieved by [[Skyra]] and [[Crysrel]] during an expedition.

Its construction lasted for 25 years, was ordered and overseen by [[Crysrel]] and revised by [[Alestra]]'s, then built for its most part with the [[Prosi Builder]], finishing with [[Alestra]]'s new [[RingBuilder|RingBuilders]], which were needed in order to finish the project, as many parts required far more precision than that of what the [[Prosi Builder]] were able to do.
