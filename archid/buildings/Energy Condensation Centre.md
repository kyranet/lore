The Energy Condensation Centre, also named ECC, is a pivotal type of building in [[Nova|Nova]], and are the supply source of all Novan EP and its variants.

## Locations
Only two ECCs were built, in [[Arc City]] (north conduit) and in [[Stella|Stella]] (south conduit).

[[Arc City]] was chosen because of its proximity to the [[Poles#North Pole|North Pole]], as well as its high defence capabilities thanks to its 2 [[Hexa 4|Hexa 4]] and its undergoing plans to build a [[Hexa 5|Hexa 5]].

[[Stella]] was chosen because of its proximity to the [[Poles#South Pole|South Pole]], as well as the outstanding performance in its [[Hexa 4|Hexa 4]], where most Novan elite units trained at.

## Defences
Due to the importance and rarity of the ECCs, they are also the most protected places in Nova, more than [[Hexa 5|Hexa 5]], which is the most protected conventional defence building. To ensure this, both ECCs come with the following defences:

- 24 [[Naeria|Naeria]] cannons
- 6 [[Naeria|Naeria]] turrets
- 18 [[Ballista|Ballista]] turrets
- 12 [[Ballista|Ballista]] cannons
- 2 [[Hexa 4|Hexa 4]] + 1 [[Hexa 5|Hexa 5]] (Arc City)
- 18 [[Relative]] cannons
- 30 [[Spectra]] turrets
- 30 high-range extreme-bandwidth omni-directional emitters
- 108 extreme-range extreme-bandwidth directional emitters

To keep up with the enormous energy demand of all its weapons at their highest fire rate and fire power, each ECC has a private energy reserve nicknamed "Armageddon Vault", which is a ready-to-use pre-processed collection of LEP, SEP, CSEP, and HCSEP.

Furthermore, both ECCs are also within operating radius of their respective city's defences, bringing an additional layer of protection.

## Controversies
1. [[ArchId|ArchId]] is a peaceful civilization, and it's why many other civilizations accept partnerships and trade relationships with them. However, ECCs' defences and the high military presence in their vicinities come in conflict with this popular view, which is one of the reasons why Nova's High Command has tried to conceal all the weapons and make the military less visible, using invisible Relative devices to prevent accidental unauthorized access.
2. ECCs are owned by Nova's High Command and cannot be moved, acted, or voted on, which comes in conflict with the trust Novans have on Nova's democracy, as the buildings are exempt of it.
3. ECCs' source code is proprietary, developed and protected by Nova's High Command, which comes in conflict with the open-source nature in the Novan networks.

Due to the building costs and the controversies, as well as the requirement for a Core Conduit to source the energy required for the functionality of the ECC, which limits the locations to near the [[Poles|Novan poles]].
