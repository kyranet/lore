ArchId Ring is a structure similar to a [matrioshka brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain), a megastructure of immense computational capacity powered by a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere), which extracts energy from [[Nova|Nova]]'s planetary core.

This building is the only one to have the name "ArchId" in it, chosen because the ArchId Ring is the civilization's main responsible for a variety of activities, including the organization of all the information collected from all the archivists spread across the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), ensuring the health of the Network by providing the core services and moderating the information, aiding in scientific research with its processing power, and coordinating defences. As such, the ArchId Ring is a vital pillar that without it, [[ArchId]] would cease to exist.

The ArchId Ring contains an [Artificial Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), named [[Ring]], a stellar virtual entity who carries out all of the tasks.

## ArchId Tower
Also named *Double-Helix Tower* or *AIT*, it's the part of the structure that's above the lithosphere. This section of the structure is protected by a crew of at least 8 [[Operator]]s and at least 2 [[ArchId Operator]]s, very often [[Iriss]] among them as the lead administrator, who also ensure [[Ring]]'s health by filtering bad actors out and constantly revising code changes.

The AIT is located at the northeast of [[Arc City]] and acts as [[Nova]]'s most powerful antenna, measuring a total of 577 metres (1,893 ft) tall, and serves as a peaceful line of defence for the city and its [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]].
