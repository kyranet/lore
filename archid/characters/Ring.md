> *Not to be confused with [[RingBuilder]].*

Ring is an [Artificial Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) without a physical body who resides in the [[ArchId Ring]], and is in charge of all the tasks. Due to this, Ring is often considered a stellar virtual entity, referencing to its planet-sized computer that is its physical body.

Ring's identity has changed many times due to various tweaks and piece replacements as they change the way Ring thinks. As such, due to the ever-changing nature, citizens avoided using pronouns and rather refer to them "Ring". Ring currently uses gender neutral pronouns to avoid confusion.

Despite being the one keeping the Network up and indirectly reaching out to every single citizen in [[Nova]], very few people have directly interacted with Ring, with [[Iriss]] being the one holding the most interactions.
