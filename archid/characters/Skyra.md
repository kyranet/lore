**Evangelyn Easton A.** (born November 24, 1984), nicknamed Skyra, is a former Canadian human citizen and Novan android citizen. Skyra is the main character of the universe due to her seniority and relevance in [[Nova]]'s history.

## Career
### 2002-2006
In 2002, a series of [[Liry]] ships landed on Earth after a long journey from [[Nova]] and abducted a small group humans from Earth, Evangelyn included, and took them back to [[Nova]], where they would help bring their culture and knowledge. However, the [[First Novan War]] broke out soon after their arrival and Evangelyn was forced to pursue a military career.

Evangelyn developed an interest in engineering roles, participating in the invention of new ways to defeat the enemy [[Kal-71]]'s defences, and pioneered the invention of the [[Mantis Scavenger]], which quickly saw success not only in breaking through the enemy cities' shield domes, but also in the elimination of armed enemy defenders within the city.

Her success sped up the Novan reconquest and in 2003, she would meet [[Aelia]], who she would then adopt as her younger sister and later collaborated with for the development of vibration-based weapons such as the [[Drakhnet]].

In 2005, her efforts would help liberate a temporary [[Kal-71]] military outpost 14 km northeast current [[Terrene]], where [[Alestra]] was held hostage in and forced by the enemy to collaborate, and from there on, [[Kal-71]] cities would soon start falling faster, as [[Alestra]]'s contributions improved Evangelyn's designs.

By late 2006, after the fall of [[Kal-71]]-occupied [[Stella]], Evangelyn was given her nickname, "Skyra", which would be known across the galaxy in the following millennia. Furthermore, Evangelyn was granted the title of Novan Tactician, earning her the rank of Captain, while also getting recognition in her engineering career.

### 2007-2012
Evangelyn's career shifted to aid in the development of new infrastructure connecting Novan cities more efficiently, and collaborated with [[Alestra]] in the development of new defensive weapons to remove the possibility of [[Kal-71]] colonising [[Nova]] again with an invasion, leading to the development of the [[Sniper]] turret in 2009.

During this time, Evangelyn tried to better understand the nature of [[Nova]] and how Novans could extract energy from it to remove the dependency with renewable solar sources, which could be halted or disabled easily by blocking the primary light source in space. However, the plans were delayed as she quickly found out that the planet is hollow and that there was no easy way to get to the old layers, let alone the core.

In 2010, Evangelyn met [[Evlyn]] at a clinic in [[Arc City]] and kept close contact with her, as her health was worsening due to multiple factors. By mid 2012, she underwent surgery to implant a [ventricular assist device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device) due to her [atrial fibrillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation).

### 2013-2046
In March 2013, [[Kal-71]] ended [[Nova]]'s 5 year peace with a large invasion attack and starting the [[Second Novan War]], which prompted Evangelyn to come back to the military and focus in the defense of [[Nova]].

In October 2018, Evangelyn married [[Crysrel]].

### 2047-2058
In April 2047, Evangelyn requested [[Aelia]] the possibility to build a [[Nexerium]] starship so she could travel to [[Earth]] and see how her family was doing after decades of being separated from her. This trip would finally happen in 2048, and Evangelyn would stay there for a week staying at her parents' house.

However, during this time, Evangelyn noticed the political landscape in many places of [[Earth]] were filled with hate and destruction, and this prompted her to talk about the possibility of stablishing formal relations between [[Nova]] and [[Earth]]. This proposal led to the founding of two organizations: the [[Political Management Organization]] in 2050 to deal with the politics of having an allied planet, and the [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization]] in 2051 to defend [[Earth]] against possible [[Kal-71]] attacks.

In June 2053, a Novan convoy led by Evangelyn and with members of the [[Political Management Organization|PMO]] and the [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization|APDO]] arrived Jupiter, with Evangelyn heading alone to [[Earth]] with her [[Nexerium]] starship displaying white lights to signal her peaceful intentions akin to a [white flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag). Her arrival was met with resistance since the US army was sending signals that Novan technology in Evangelyn's starship couldn't properly communicate with, due to protocol incompatibilities in the communication the army was trying to establish, which led to a pre-emptive missile strikes to ward her off so she couldn't enter the atmosphere. However, Evangelyn ignored the attacks and dodged the missiles until she eventually landed her ship near the United Nations' headquarters.

At the United Nations HQ, Terran soldiers quickly swarmed around her ship, being of extra-terrestrial origin, and Evangelyn left the ship with the shields still on in case somebody tried to shoot at her, and started explaining who she was and why she was there. Given greenlight, the rest of the convoy arrived with her and posed several ways a treaty between [[Nova]] and [[Earth]] could be done. At the end, several nations refused the peace proposals because they couldn't trust a much more advanced civilization and preferred to be on their own despite the threat of a possible [[Kal-71]] invasion on [[Earth]], which some government officials claimed was fearmongering, resulting on a failure.

Evangelyn's health also worsened during this decade, requiring multiple surgeries as complications with her [ventricular assist device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device) appeared alongside multiple infections from her previous expeditions outside [[Nova]] affecting her lungs and liver. Despite Novan medicine being very advanced, Evangelyn's health issues weren't reacting as effectively as hoped, leading to the acceleration of the development of the Cyborg Program, which could potentially improve her damaged organs with synthetic ones.

However, despite the positive aspects of the Cyborg Program and its potential to give Evangelyn a healthy body and more years to live, Evangelyn denied the treatment multiple times at the start because the technology wasn't tested, and due to the lack of resources, she would have to carry a prototype.

Eventually in February 2058, [[Aelia]] and [[Crysrel]] managed to convince Evangelyn to undergo the operation under the basis that she had very few years left to live, and that by offering herself to the program would help the researchers gather real time information, which they would be able to later use for further improvements. However, Evangelyn chose to proceed with the condition that her physical aspect must be preserved.

### 2059-2255
In January 2059, after a lot of preparation and preliminary tests, Evangelyn underwent the surgery, which turned to be a success. Her new body was fully mechanical, with only her human brain being preserved.

However, Evangelyn's physical aspect couldn't be fully preserved due to limitations in some areas, giving her a blue hair (as opposed to her natural blonde hair). The aspect was based on when she was 32 years old, and wore a black visor to protect and aid her new bionic eyes in the process.

This success set precedent for many Novans to transition to cyborgs, which also extended the lifespan of a human from 94 years to 284 years, ending with the degradation of the human brain despite the cybernetic body's efforts to keep the brain healthy and running for much longer than naturally possible.

Evangelyn had two surgeries during this time period, one at 2062 to improve her motor response using recent medical breakthroughs by [[Evlyn]] that helped understand the human brain better, and another at 2188, to upgrade most of her components for extra mobility and strength as well as the ability to add external modules to help with her missions.

### 2256-2267
In April 2256, Evangelyn received word from [[Evlyn]] and her team that a new technology was available to further extend her life expectancy and powered by [[N-AI]], an experimental [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) program capable of holding a human conscience, which she agreed to as Evangelyn claimed she wasn't ready to die as despite her long life, many still needed her help.

Since then, scientists worked for a couple of years to study and profile the information from Evangelyn's cyborg system, which gave them the needed data to localise the consciousness and transfer it to the new android body. In September 2258, the operation was complete, however, she faced many issues as [[N-AI]] had such as the lack of the ability to imagine or think abstract ideas, which basically made her engineering career much harder for her, as she struggled to invent new things or collaborate in other inventions.

It wasn't until late 2267 when [[Alestra]], under the mentorship of [[Teryl]], wrote the basis of the [[NEμBOT]] program, a much more advanced adaptive self-improving system that solved all the issues [[N-AI]] had. This was successfully implemented in Evangelyn, although future patches were needed including a critical patch to safeguard against logical paradoxes, which almost claimed Evangelyn's life.

### 2268-2281
By 2268, Evangelyn finally got used to her new body and mind, and [[NEμBOT]] started rewriting her hardware to better fit her conscience and her way of thinking. This opened the doors for many possibilities, as she possessed superhuman strength and processing speed. She and her technicians were convinced of the potential of the new technologies and got to work changing the hardware input parameters, leading to the creation of the first classes.

As the resources for more [[NEμBOT]] androids became more readily available and the technology stabilised, more engineers transitioned over the years, leading in the number of computer breakthroughs increasing at a faster peace. In May 2279, Evangelyn volunteered for the prototype class — fifth in its time — [[Aerum]], which had a faster reaction time and an improved sensor capability. The prototype would be installed in 2281.

In September 2279, Evangelyn, [[Crysrel]] and [[Alestra]] started a 6-month expedition at [[Xaminar]]'s abandoned capital planet, [[Xin]], in the search of blueprints and new technologies from the planet's research centres and laboratories. The expedition ended earlier in January 2280 when they found a prototype robot attached to a quantum computer, named [[Iriss]], who they would bring back to [[Nova]] alongside the quantum computer's core.

### 2282-3115
In 2282, Evangelyn started her a career as a space explorer alongside her partner, [[Crysrel]], and together held a long expedition gathering a lot of data. The first expedition ended in 3015 due to technical issues in the starships, and arrived back at [[Nova]] in 3017 after 735 years of exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations, boldly going where no Novan has gone before.

In 3018, Evangelyn and [[Crysrel]] organised a year long vacation to celebrate their 1000th anniversary visiting the new cities that were built at [[Nova]] during their absence.

In 3020, the couple went out for a second expedition after their starships were repaired, and finished in 3115 after a series of malfunctions in Evangelyn's [[Nexerium]] ship that were caused by its propulsion crystal wearing out.

After each expedition, the pair extracted the raw data from their cold storage system and transmitted it to the newly built [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|ArchId Tower]] at [[Arc City]], which would process the new information.

### 3116-3721
In 3116, Evangelyn's [[Nexerium]] starship was checked by [[Alestra]], however, the wear damage was too deep and couldn't be repaired, resulting on the ship being transported to the [[Technical University of Arc]], where it would be cleaned up and displayed to the passing students of the university.

[[Alestra]] had plans to build a new starship dedicated to exploration, but the development of deep space technologies were improving too rapidly to the point a starship would be obsolete by a much superior option each year. Evangelyn then decided to go back to her previous engineer career and in 3118, she was assigned at [[Poles#North Pole|North Pole]] where she would learn the true nature of [[Nova]].

In 3188, Evangelyn was assigned a new mission to escort [[Teryl]] to Sector 0A, near [[Earth]], using a [[Nessel]] warship, and kept guard of the area while a fleet of [[RingBuilder]]s were building a large library and archive ship, which would then be [[Teryl]]'s home. After the construction finished, Evangelyn visited [[Earth]] and tested the communication link with the library and its proxy link to [[Nova]], before going back to [[Nova]].

In 3233, Evangelyn alongside [[Crysrel]], [[Aelia]], [[Alestra]], and [[Paris]], founded the [[Suntream Dynasty]], and all the members would wear a golden version of the logo at a visible place of their clothes to recognise their relationship as a family.

In 3721, newly stablished librarians at the edge of [[ArchId]]'s explored area discovered the presence of a space anomaly emanating a lot of energy. Evangelyn decided to check it out and determine whether or not it was dangerous. The unidentified object turned to be the [[Sxry]], a sword of unknown origin and unknown composition that generated a constant supply of energy, and full of markings on both sides, [[Suntream Dynasty]]'s logo among them.

### 3722-3744
The discovery of the [[Sxry]] puzzled the [[Suntream Dynasty]], as nobody ever built it, and there were no records of any other civilization using the same logo. For this reason, the family carried many tests to determine the origin and composition of the sword to no avail, even with the [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|ArchId Tower]]'s ever-growing highly detailed library collection database spanning the information from 65% of the Milky Way.

During the two decades, Evangelyn started getting new memories starting with the name "Skyra" appearing over and over. The family realised after a lot of testing that the nickname was only given to Evangelyn and that the sword followed only Evangelyn.

In 3739, it was determined that the [[Sxry]]'s power source was named [[Sxry#Lynn Gate|Lynn Gate]] and that it yielded a constant energy supply of 6 EWh, or 6 trillion MWh, however, all attempts to identify the sword's composition failed, as the findings seemingly always contradicted what was known. Following the investigation, the family tried to use the [[Sxry]] as a power source, however, this also failed, as the sword only let Evangelyn use its energy supply.

In 3744, Evangelyn started using the nickname Skyra after receiving memories of her past life with the same name.

### 3745-3746
In 3745, a librarian near [[Redlan]]'s home planet at the edge of [[ArchId]]'s librarian network detected a large invasion force of [[Kal-71]] and [[Gessherd]] ships, this force arrived at [[Nova]] on 3746, triggering the [[Third Novan War]]. During the invasion, the [[Sxry]] travelled to the [[Poles#South Pole|South Pole]] and later to [[Nova]]'s core, then appeared right besides Evangelyn, who was at the [[Poles#North Pole|North Pole]] trying to defend against the [[Gessherd]] forces, until the [[Incinerator Tower]]s enabled for first time and shot a continuous stream vertically at the sky, causing [[Nova]] to restart the atmosphere, killing all the [[Gessherd]] forces in the process.

### 3747-3898
In 3747, [[Alestra]] completed a new starship with great combat capabilities and with the integration of the [[Sxry]] as an additional energy source in mind. This opened the door for more powerful weapons that were limited to [[Nova]] and backed up by large energy grids. One such introduction was the [[Spectra]] cannons as well as a [[Sniper]] cannon in the centre for long-range attacks.

To accommodate for this advanced weapon arsenal, a new [[NEμBOT]] class was created, [[Electrawing]], and thus Skyra's new warship codename would be `WPEW-EEA-0`. The upgrade finished in 3752, but unlike her previous class, where she was the only one of her class, there would be 250 [[Electrawing]]-class built after her, who was the prototype.

In 3755, a small fleet of 120 [[Electrawing]] warships, 45 [[Noirwing]] support ships, 5 [[Tesserium]] scout warships, and a [[Thaesse]] support ship with [[Iriss]] marched further into [[ArchId]] non-mapped space, with a fleet building new libraries to connect more sectors of the Milky Way into the scanning grid.

The fleet encountered resistance from many enemy [[Kal-71]] outposts found during the expedition, however, despite being outnumbered in almost every case, the fleet survived the expedition until 3898 with minimal loses. At this point, [[ArchId]] had a library in almost every sector of the Milky Way: most of galaxy is now actively mapped and scanned, with all the data going to the [[ArchId Ring]] and finally creating an accurate and very detailed map tracking every single event in the scanned sectors.

However, despite not finding any more [[Kal-71]] outposts, or any [[Gessherd]] colonies within the scanned sectors, librarians still picked up unidentified activity from time to time near the galaxy's borders. [[ArchId]] officials sent fleets to colonise planets in neighbouring sectors so they could create permanent settlements for military androids to live in with comfortable conditions far away from their home planet [[Nova]].

### 3899-3952
For slightly over 5 decades, Skyra was given the task to see new colonisers to their new homes and ensure their safety while the outposts were being built. For several occasions, Skyra had to respond to distress calls from trading cargo ships who were attacked by nearby enemy sources while transporting resources from [[Nova]] to the colonies.

### 3953-4412
> [!reminder]
> 3953 is a vital year for [[ArchId]] after the a joint operation between the [[Adstra University]], the [[Technical University of Arc]], and the [[Autonomous University of Arc]] made a breakthrough that allowed the construction of a mechanism to extract energy from the core of [[Nova]]. This also allowed the construction of facilities to create limitless amounts of energy at higher rate than existing fusion generators.
>
> In 3955, the construction of the High Energy Novan Grid started at [[Arc City]] connecting to the three universities, and was completed in 4014. During this time, the universities made a second breakthrough, they condensed the generation of 6 months of the HENV's grid energy into a gaseous compound named [[Pure Energy]]. The concept was scaled up and plans for a massive building named [[Energy Condensation Centre]] northeast [[Arc City]]. The [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]] allowed the creation of a much more dense version of the compound, which was then named [[Pure Energy|Liquid Electronplasma]], or LEP for short.

3953 was a start of a new energy era in [[ArchId]], and later in 4410, following many breakthroughs, the [[Novan Heart]] was invented and scheduled for implementation in many androids, Skyra among them.

### 4413-33150
In 4413, Skyra transitioned to [[Flamewing]] alongside 49 more androids. This upgrade from [[Electrawing]] was significant, as it included the [[Novan Heart]], an energy supply made of [[Pure Energy#Liquid Form|LEP]], and an upgraded processing array going from 2 neural and 4 arithmetic processors to 6 neural, 8 arithmetic, and a data processing processor, which was miniaturized using hyperspace compression technology. The last upgrade was that her capacitive artificial skin was replaced with a nanite mesh that projected hard light, which was not possible to achieve before due to energy consumption.

Skyra also received a new starship, courtesy of [[Alestra]], the agile space superiority warship codenamed `WAFW-EEA-A1`, which could complete the travel from [[Nova]] to [[Earth]] in under one hour, compared to the 3 weeks of the previous design. The warship also featured 2 large backup [[Pure Energy#Liquid Form|LEP]] batteries which would be used to offload energy consumption from Skyra's heart and push speeds never seen before.

Using this technology, Skyra started doing a series of expeditions further outside the galaxy, arriving at the [Canis Major Overdensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major_Overdensity)  before going back to [[Nova]] in 10004 allegedly for repairs and upgrades. In 10008, Skyra went out for a 10 year long vacation with [[Crysrel]] to celebrate their 10000th anniversary, finishing in 10018.

In 10020, with an improved warship featuring hyperspace compressed data banks and more efficient [[Pure Energy#Liquid Form|LEP]] banks, Skyra started another expedition, this time to [Segue 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue_1), then the nearby [Ursa Major II Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_II_Dwarf), finishing at the [Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_Dwarf_Spheroidal_Galaxy) before going back to [[Nova]] for refuelling and data uploading in 33150.

### 33151-99350
In 33151, [[Alestra]] told Skyra that she had prepared an exploration starship integrating a cutting-edge [[Archivist]]-class data collector with a [[Flamewing]]-class armour, an improved propulsion system, and a more efficient energy source. Skyra herself also got hardware improvements, mostly to implement the latest energy technologies for even higher efficiency, a pair of [[Noir Blades]] in her arms, and a cloak system to hide in case of an enemy invasion.

Her new starship had additional room for a data processor, specifically a [[Librarian]]-class android to help sort out the raw data and optimising the data storage on the fly.

In 33158, all preparations were complete, and so Skyra made her way to the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) alongside its satellite galaxies, making many new discoveries, charting the galaxies, and finding new civilizations. The expedition ended in 99350.

## Personal life
Skyra has been married to [[Crysrel]] and has 1 adoptive sister, [[Aelia]], and is closely related to [[Alestra]], and [[Evlyn]].
