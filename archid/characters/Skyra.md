**Evangelyn Easton A.** (born November 24, 1984), nicknamed Skyra, is a former Canadian human citizen and Novan android citizen. Skyra is the main character of the universe due to her seniority and relevance in [[Nova]]'s history.

## Career
### 2002-2006
In 2002, a series of [[Liry]] ships landed on Earth after a long journey from [[Nova]] and abducted a small group humans from Earth, Evangelyn included, and took them back to [[Nova]], where they would help bring their culture and knowledge. However, the [[First Novan War]] broke out soon after their arrival and Evangelyn was forced to pursue a military career.

Evangelyn developed an interest in engineering roles, participating in the invention of new ways to defeat the enemy [[Kal-71]]'s defences, and pioneered the invention of the [[Mantis Scavenger]], which quickly saw success not only in breaking through the enemy cities' shield domes, but also in the elimination of armed enemy defenders within the city.

Her success sped up the Novan reconquest and in 2003, she would meet [[Aelia]], who she would then adopt as her younger sister and later collaborated with for the development of vibration-based weapons such as the [[Drakhnet]].

In 2005, her efforts would help liberate a temporary [[Kal-71]] military outpost 14 km northeast current [[Terrene]], where [[Alestra]] was held hostage in and forced by the enemy to collaborate, and from there on, [[Kal-71]] cities would soon start falling faster, as [[Alestra]]'s contributions improved Evangelyn's designs.

By late 2006, after the fall of [[Kal-71]]-occupied [[Stella]], Evangelyn was given her nickname, "Skyra", which would be known across the galaxy in the following millennia. Furthermore, Evangelyn was granted the title of Novan Tactician, earning her the rank of Captain, while also getting recognition in her engineering career.

### 2007-2012
Evangelyn's career shifted to aid in the development of new infrastructure connecting Novan cities more efficiently, and collaborated with [[Alestra]] in the development of new defensive weapons to remove the possibility of [[Kal-71]] colonising [[Nova]] again with an invasion, leading to the development of the [[Sniper]] turret in 2009.

During this time, Evangelyn tried to better understand the nature of [[Nova]] and how Novans could extract energy from it to remove the dependency with renewable solar sources, which could be halted or disabled easily by blocking the primary light source in space. However, the plans were delayed as she quickly found out that the planet is hollow and that there was no easy way to get to the old layers, let alone the core.

In 2010, Evangelyn met [[Evlyn]] at a clinic in [[Arc City]] and kept close contact with her, as her health was worsening due to multiple factors. By mid 2012, she underwent surgery to implant a [ventricular assist device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device) due to her [atrial fibrillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation).

### 2013-2046
In March 2013, [[Kal-71]] ended [[Nova]]'s 5 year peace with a large invasion attack and starting the [[Second Novan War]], which prompted Evangelyn to come back to the military and focus in the defense of [[Nova]].

### 2047-2058
In April 2047, Evangelyn requested [[Aelia]] the possibility to build a [[Nexerium]] starship so she could travel to [[Earth]] and see how her family was doing after decades of being separated from her. This trip would finally happen in 2048, and Evangelyn would stay there for a week staying at her parents' house.

However, during this time, Evangelyn noticed the political landscape in many places of [[Earth]] were filled with hate and destruction, and this prompted her to talk about the possibility of stablishing formal relations between [[Nova]] and [[Earth]]. This proposal led to the founding of two organizations: the [[Political Management Organization]] in 2050 to deal with the politics of having an allied planet, and the [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization]] in 2051 to defend [[Earth]] against possible [[Kal-71]] attacks.

In June 2053, a Novan convoy led by Evangelyn and with members of the [[Political Management Organization|PMO]] and the [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization|APDO]] arrived Jupiter, with Evangelyn heading alone to [[Earth]] with her [[Nexerium]] starship displaying white lights to signal her peaceful intentions akin to a [white flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag). Her arrival was met with resistance since the US army was sending signals that Novan technology in Evangelyn's starship couldn't properly communicate with, due to protocol incompatibilities in the communication the army was trying to establish. Evangelyn dodged the defensive projectiles and eventually entered inside the US territory and landed her ship near the United Nations' headquarters. American soldiers quickly swarmed around her ship, being of extra-terrestrial origin, but Evangelyn left the ship nevertheless with the shields still on in case somebody tried to shoot at her. Eventually, Evangelyn explained who she was and why she was there. At the end, the UN refused the peace proposals because they couldn't trust a much more advanced civilization and preferred to be on their own despite the threat of a possible [[Kal-71]] invasion on [[Earth]], which some government officials claimed was fearmongering.

Evangelyn's health also worsened during this decade, requiring multiple surgeries as complications with her [ventricular assist device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device) appeared alongside multiple infections from her previous expeditions outside [[Nova]] affecting her lungs and liver. Despite Novan medicine being very advanced, Evangelyn's health issues weren't reacting as effectively as hoped, leading to the acceleration of the development of the Cyborg Program, which could potentially improve her damaged organs with synthetic ones.

However, despite the positive aspects of the Cyborg Program and its potential to give Evangelyn a healthy body and more years to live, Evangelyn denied the treatment multiple times at the start because the technology wasn't tested, and due to the lack of resources, she would have to carry a prototype.

Eventually in February 2058, [[Aelia]] and [[Crysrel]] managed to convince Evangelyn to undergo the operation under the basis that he had very few years left to live, and that by offering herself to the program would help the researchers gather real time information, which they would be able to later use for further improvements. However, Evangelyn chose to proceed with the condition that her physical aspect must be preserved.

### 2059-2255
In January 2059, after a lot of preparation and preliminary tests, Evangelyn underwent the surgery, which turned to be a success. Her new body was fully mechanical, with only her human brain being preserved.

However, Evangelyn's physical aspect couldn't be fully preserved due to limitations in some areas, giving her a blue hair (as opposed to her natural blonde hair). The aspect was based on when she was 32 years old, and wore a black visor to protect and aid her new bionic eyes in the process.

This success set precedent for many Novans to transition to cyborgs, which also extended the lifespan of a human from 94 years to 284 years, ending with the degradation of the human brain despite the cybernetic body's efforts to keep the brain healthy and running for much longer than naturally possible.

Evangelyn had two surgeries during this time period, one at 2062 to improve her motor response using recent medical breakthroughs by [[Evlyn]] that helped understand the human brain better, and another at 2188, to upgrade most of her components for extra mobility and strength as well as the ability to add external modules to help with her missions.

### 2256-2267
In April 2256, Evangelyn received word from [[Evlyn]] and her team that a new technology was available to further extend her life expectancy and powered by [[N-AI]], an experimental [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) program capable of holding a human conscience, which she agreed to as Evangelyn claimed she wasn't ready to die as despite her long life, many still needed her help.

Since then, scientists worked for a couple of years to study and profile the information from Evangelyn's cyborg system, which gave them the needed data to localise the consciousness and transfer it to the new android body. In September 2258, the operation was complete, however, she faced many issues as [[N-AI]] had such as the lack of the ability to imagine or think abstract ideas, which basically made her engineering career much harder for her, as she struggled to invent new things or collaborate in other inventions.

It wasn't until late 2267 when [[Alestra]], under the mentorship of [[Teryl]], wrote the basis of the [[NEμBOT]] program, a much more advanced adaptive self-improving system that solved all the issues [[N-AI]] had. This was successfully implemented in Evangelyn, although future patches were needed including a critical patch to safeguard against logical paradoxes, which almost claimed Evangelyn's life.

### 2268-2733
By 2268, Evangelyn finally got used to her new body and mind, and [[NEμBOT]] started rewriting her hardware to better fit her conscience and her way of thinking. This opened the doors for many possibilities, as she possessed superhuman strength and processing speed.

## Personal life
Skyra has been married to [[Crysrel]] and has 1 adoptive sisters, [[Aelia]], and is closely related to [[Alestra]], and [[Evlyn]].
