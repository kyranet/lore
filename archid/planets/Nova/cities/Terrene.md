Terrene is a near-coastal city surrounded by a forest. The city has around 135,000 inhabitants and covers a geographical area of 250 kmÂ². Terrene lies near the coast of northern [[Lumia]], near [[Nova|Nova]]'s equator, and serves as a hub to connect the [[Novan Rail Network]] with [[Vertia]] through its hybrid variant, the [[Hybrid Novan Rail Network]], at the south.

## Etymology
The name "Terrene" comes from Latin, and it means "earthly, terrestrial, of or pertaining to the earth", referencing to it being a coastal city that doesn't build near the beaches, where the sea is at, and also that it was initially built as a hub that allows people in [[Nova|Nova]] to visit its suboceanic neighbour city, [[Vertia]].
