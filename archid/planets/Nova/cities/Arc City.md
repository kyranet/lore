Arc City is a [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state) as well as the capital and most populous city in [[Nova|Nova]]. The city has around 18.5 million inhabitants and covers a total geographical area of 1820 km². Arc City lies on the Northern Flatlands in the northernmost part of [[Nova|Nova]], near the [[Poles#North Pole|North Pole]], and is also the political and cultural centre of the planet. The city is situated on an elevated plain about 140 km (97 mi) from the closest seaside location. The climate of Arc City features mild summers and cool winters.

Arc City also houses the [[#ArchId Foundation Headquarters]].

## Etymology
The origin of the toponym "Arc City" is closely related to the city back during the [[First Novan War]], when the city featured a defence system that used arcs of energy to stop enemies from approaching the city.

## History
The site of modern-day Arc City has been occupied since the creation of the lithosphere, and served as a home for the first inhabitants of this planetary layer. There are underground sites below the city linked to Artic, a northern defensive military settlement that was closed down when the lithosphere was finished.

## Geography
### Location
Arc City is slightly unique in [[Nova|Nova]] due to a large part of its area being flat land, most of which is covered with vegetation and has an average altitude of 340 m (1115 ft). There is a slight difference in altitude within the city proper ranging from the 394 m (1292 ft) around the [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|ArchId Tower]] at the northeast to the 314 m (1030 ft) around the [[Adstra]] river in the westmost.

The oldest urban core is located between the two of the city's rivers, [[Adstra]] and [[Anni]], where the [[Wonders#Forum of Arc|Forum of Arc]] is located at. The city grew to the north, reaching the location of the current city's [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]], before growing in all directions.

Like with many other Novan cities, Arc City also features verticality and [commensalism symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism) with nature, where the city develops without harming nature or any of the species living within the existing forest.

The space visibility area of Arc City is the highest in [[Nova|Nova]], with a 18% of the built area being visible to space. Most of the built area is hidden by trees, within cliffs, or in underground systems. Some notable buildings use dim lights that are lit during the night.

### Parks and forests
Arc City, being [[Nova]]'s largest city, it has the highest number of trees in the planet, with approximately 80,080,000 units. The city's citizens have access to a green area within a 5-minute walk. At present, 70% of Arc City's area is green area, meaning that there are 68.86 m² (741.2 ft²) of green area per inhabitant, that is, the lowest in all of Nova.

Arc City features a very large forest, making up of 50% of the green area (35% of Arc City's total area), in which many buildings are built in, alongside the parks, which are either artificial ([[#Forum of Arc]]'s gardens and parks) or natural (from the forest), and are nearly everywhere in the city.

### Climate
Arc City has a [continental Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate "Humid continental climate") ([Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): _Dsb_) and experiences wet and cool winters with mild summers. The average annual temperature is 10.7 ºC or 51.2 ºF. 

Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot and humid days with occasional rain every month. The average daily high in August is 21.2 ºC or 70.16 ºF. Days with more than 1 mm (0.04 in) are common, on average 154 days per year.

## Culture
### Architecture
Little Steele is preserved in Arc City, 

### Nightlife
Arc City is an international hub of active and diverse nightlife with establishments having extra shifts to cover the night until 1:30 a.m., although in some areas, some of them stay open until at least 2:45 a.m., giving citizens time to get home by 3:30 a.m., the hour at which public transport reduces activities to save up energy and reduce night-time noise.

Nightlife flourishes in Arc City because the city's infrastructure makes it easier to spend time safely during night time, as it has significantly less wilderness area, which makes night picnics safer as well as reducing the citizens' impact on wildlife during the night, which is a regulation that [[Nova]] actively seeks to keep in order to keep a healthy symbiosis between nature and the cities.

## Education
>*Main article: [[Education in Nova]]*

Education in [[Nova]] is free, and compulsory from 4 to 15 years.

### Universities
Arc City is home to many universities. Some of them are the oldest in the world, and many of them are praised for keeping the quality standards well beyond the compulsory recommendations from Novan laws.

The [[Adstra University]] (AU) is the largest university in the city and the second largest in [[Nova]]. It was founded a year after the [[First Novan War]]. the [[Adstra University|AU]] is aimed to teach most topics, for which it's very large, but has a special focus and recognition in anything related to space.

The [[Technical University of Arc]] (TUA) is the top technical university in [[Nova]]. It is also the oldest one, and its reputation is due to its notable alumni, who helped further expand the knowledge of the university, and created inventions that drastically changed [[Nova]] forever. It shares the western and northern part of the University City with the [[Adstra University|AU]].

The [[Autonomous University of Arc]] (AUA) was instituted under the leadership of a scientist organisation. The Autonomous University is widely recognised for its research strengths in [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics). It shares the eastern and southern part of the University City with the [[Adstra University|AU]].

## Transport
After the [[Second Novan War]], the government of Arc City deemed the planet, and thus the city itself, as safe enough to start worrying more on maintaining a symbiotic relationship with nature, which would subsequently improve the health and the living conditions of all of its citizens.

Part of the regulations include regulating the flow of individual vehicles to reduce the noise generated to the environment, as well as the requirement to include night vision capabilities for travelling during the night.

Other regulations required the public transport system to be developed to such standards that not only it would be able to quickly take anyone across the entire city within 30 minutes, but its coverage would be high enough to the point it would be accessible and useful for everyone.

Further regulations on individual vehicle ownership and the available parking space would further discourage the development and usage of said vehicles, which eventually found themselves replaced by a safer and faster public transport system.

### Public transport
There are 2 major components of public transport, with many [intermodal interchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_hub "Transport hub").
#### Metro
The Metro is a [rapid transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit "Rapid transit") system in Arc City, operating urban and suburban transit services to all 12 of the city's municipal districts. Served as part of the *Arc Rail Transit*, the Arc Metro system is [[Nova]]'s biggest metro system by route length, totalling 672 kilometres (417 mi). It is also the biggest by the number of stations with 341 stations on 15 lines. It ranks first in [[Nova]] by annual ridership with 1.89 billion rides delivered in each year. Over 6 million people use the system on an average workday, accounting for 79% of public transport trips in Arc City.

#### Bus
There is a dense network of [bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus "Bus") routes, having around 814 formal lines, which operate according to demand. Bus is typically used as a shortcut to avoid switching between several Metro lines to arrive at a place faster, however, it also runs less frequently, specially after 3:30 a.m.

### Long-distance transport
In terms of longer-distance transport, Arc City is directly connected to all nearby cities, thanks to the [[Novan Rail Network]], which objective is to connect all Novan cities by rail.

## International relations
### Diplomacy
The [[#ArchId Foundation Headquarters]] in Arc City includes the Novan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the embassies for the following civilizations: [[Human]], [[Redlan]], [[Xaminar]], among others.

### International organizations
The [[#ArchId Foundation Headquarters]] hosts the [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization]] (APDO), [[Anti-Piracy Organization]] (APO), the [[Artificially Destroyed Planet Reconnaissance Organization]] (ADPRO), the [[Enemy Reconnaissance Organization]] (ERO), the [[Galactic Support Organization]] (GSO), the [[Galactic Trade Regulation Organization]] (GTRO), the [[Military Support Organization]] (MSO), the [[Organization for the Defence of Universal Flora]] (ODUF), the [[Planetary Government Control Organization]] (PGCO), the [[Political Management Organization]] (PMO), and the [[Trade Regulation Organization]] (TRO).

## Notable Buildings
Arc City is home to many notable buildings that are well recognised in [[Nova|Nova]], and some of Nova's [[Wonders|wonders]].

### Forum of Arc
>*Main article: [[Wonders#Forum of Arc|Forum of Arc]]*

The Forum of Arc is [[Nova|Nova]]'s oldest [[Wonders|wonder]], it's built in the centre of Arc City and is completely visible from space.

It's built between the city's two rivers, [[Adstra]] and [[Anni]], and features 8 paths in 4 directions, each path was built next to parks where many citizens bring their animal companions to pass the time or exercise together. In some areas, crossing a bridge is required to reach the park, as opposed to having a small one with a bridge to the main parks.

On the other side of the path, citizens can find pillars that narrate Nova's history from start to finish if you enter the right path at the south and walk the eight paths anticlockwise. Each pillar features inscriptions, but also contain a panel where the citizen can read or even listen to the written part. The information is also readily and easily accessible to anyone on Nova.

In the centre of the Forum of Arc, there's a floating vantage point accessible by teleports and lifts at the base, but also features a small port for public transit to pass through.

### Energy Condensation Centre
>*Main article: [[Energy Condensation Centre|Energy Condensation Centre]]*

Located near the northeast outskirts of Arc City, the [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]] is the city's tallest and most protected building, measuring 723 metres (2,372 ft) long.

The appearance of the [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]] consists of 4 tilted white pillars that closely resemble a pyramid alongside walls between them that hide the interior of the building from the outside. The walls are made of a special classified metal that has an extreme resistance, and are covered by marble, giving the building the white colour. The pillars are decorated with marble of different colours, predominantly pink.

Because [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]]s are a restricted area, walls have been built on the outside to prevent accidental entrance, and air public transport have routes far from them. If a vehicle goes near, the autopilot will engage to avoid entering its airspace.

### ArchId Tower
>*Main article: [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|ArchId Tower]]*

The [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|Archid Tower]] is home to [[ArchId Operator]]s, who hold control of the operation of the [[ArchId Ring]], as well as form part of the administrative part of Nova's High Command. The building is on the northeast of the city, roughly 4.5 km (2.8 mi) away from the city's [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]].

The [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|AIT]] also acts as [[Nova]]'s most powerful antenna, measuring a total of 577 metres (1,893 ft) tall, and serves as a peaceful line of defence for the city and its [[Energy Condensation Centre|ECC]].

The [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|AIT]]'s area and airspace are not restricted, however, all movements inside them are highly monitored, and a notice is sent to users when they are about to enter it. Public transport go around the structure to avoid consent issues with the passengers. However, the [[ArchId Ring#ArchId Tower|AIT]] may override the consent preference if it detects dangerous actions from a user, which then may proceed to do a full "mind scan" to determine the intentions.

### ArchId Foundation Headquarters
The ArchId Foundation Headquarters is a collection of buildings hosting the following organizations:

- [[Allied Planetary Defence Organization]] (APDO)
- [[Anti-Piracy Organization]] (APO)
- [[Artificially Destroyed Planet Reconnaissance Organization]] (ADPRO)
- [[Enemy Reconnaissance Organization]] (ERO)
- [[Galactic Support Organization]] (GSO)
- [[Galactic Trade Regulation Organization]] (GTRO)
- [[Military Support Organization]] (MSO)
- [[Organization for the Defence of Universal Flora]] (ODUF)
- [[Planetary Government Control Organization]] (PGCO)
- [[Political Management Organization]] (PMO)
- [[Trade Regulation Organization]] (TRO)

## Defences
Arc City's importance as [[Nova]]'s capital city, as well as its high visibility from space, makes it a prime target for [[Kal-71]], which has tried to occupy the city ever since it was founded. To prevent such event from happening, the city features a large list of defences.

### Notable Defences

#### Arc Shield
The Arc Shield is a very powerful energy shield generator with a radius large enough to cover the entire city. A total of 48 equidistant pillars exist in a circle with the main generator at its centre, and can operate at nominal levels with as low as 30 pillars. The composition and properties of the shield can change depending on the kind of attack it's about to receive.

##### Upgrades
- [[Hivii]] can create patches on top of the shields to reduce the incoming enemy attacks on the Arc Shield, and if upgraded by [[Spectra]], the [[Hivii]] can let go the second layer and use the Arch Shield instead.
- [[Spectra]] turrets can help keeping the integrity of the shield by shooting where the generator's beam touches the shield, which in turn temporarily upgrades the shield to increase energy repulsion.
- [[Relative]] cannons can further upgrade the shield to increase (or decrease) the energy absorption in specific areas of the shield, which will improve the durability of the shield.

##### Backups
- Arc Shield has 6 smaller secondary shield generators, which will activate in case the main shield is about to fall. The strength of each generator is much smaller than the main one, but it can be reinforced with [[Spectra]] turrets and smaller sets of [[Hivii]].
- In case the secondary shield generators fail, a tertiary set of 18 soft shields will fire up with a partial protection against energy weapons but a high disruptive effect on passing vehicles and weapons.
- If the tertiary shields are about to fail or are useless to the threat, the [[#Cyan]] will be started, which will deploy a very powerful temporary shield dome on the city while it completes the firing sequence.
- Before [[#Cyan]] fails, a large network of [[Sniper]] towers as well as elite units will engage in defending Arc City as a last resort.

However, it's likely that [[Iriss]] or [[Skyra]] will come and put the battle to an abrupt end before the first backup is even deployed.

#### Hivii
>*Main article: [[Hivii]]*

The [[Hivii]] is a portable unit that can operate both in space and in the atmosphere. The units work by coordinating and sharing an energy buffer among multiple [[Hivii]], and typically arrange themselves as a double layer composed of a triangular mesh, where the first layer absorbs an enemy's attack while the second layer is on stand-by storing, redirecting excess energy, and keeping the energy levels of the first layer at nominal levels.

The first layer's shields are highly absorptive, transforming most of the incoming energy into energy the [[Hivii]] can feed back to the shields, store, or redirect to avoid overcharging.

The second layer's shields are highly reactive, as it's where excess energy dissipates and converted for the first layer, and it's absolutely forbidden for Novan units to even touch them, as it can easily disrupt the [[Hivii]] energy matrix.

A triple-layer configuration is also possible, where the third layer would be a mixture of absorptive and reactive, which makes the mesh much harder to sabotage, but it's less efficient as it requires many extra units.

Arc City has a large number of [[Hivii]], totalling 2200.
