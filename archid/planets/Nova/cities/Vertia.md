Vertia is the largest suboceanic city and the second most vertical city in [[Nova|Nova]]. The city has around 350,000 inhabitants and covers a total geographical area of 55 kmÂ². Vertia lies on the ocean bed of northern [[Lumia]], near [[Nova|Nova]]'s equator, and is one of the largest cultural centres of the planet. The city is surrounded by ocean rifts where it sources natural geothermal energy to keep its citizens warm, and is about 25 km (15.5 mi) from the closest seaside location at the north. The climate of Vertia features chill summers and cold winters.

Vertia is surrounded by structures that extend shields surrounding most of the city, specially the rifts, to keep the pressure inside at 1 atmosphere, allowing citizens to come in and out of the city without the need to pressurize or depressurize. The rifts on which structures are built are artificial as to not break [commensalism symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism) with nature, keeping the natural ones intact and accessible with the usage of suboceanic vehicles.

## Etymology
The origin of the toponym "Vertia" is closely related to the Latin word vertex, meaning "peak" or "summit", referencing to the towering structures that rise from the ocean floor and its numerous oceanic rifts, creating a vertical landscape.

## History
Vertia was founded after the [[Second Novan War]] as a secret military research base completely invisible from space, but after [[Kal-71]] gave up on colonizing [[Nova|Nova]] after the activation of its core and its defences, Vertia's research base was broken down and transformed into its Forum.

## Geography
### Location
Vertia is covered with vegetation and has numerous artificial rivers with coral reefs and algae to provide oxygen to its citizens alongside some species from the ocean bed that can survive in Vertia's lower pressure environment. The city has a top altitude of -350 m (-382 yd) at its Forum with the deepest rifts reaching -850 m (929 yd).

The oldest urban core is located near the city's Forum, in an artificial rift. The city grew mainly to the south and east, as the depth decreases at the north and west areas.

Like with many other Novan cities, Vertia also features verticality and [commensalism symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism) with nature, where the city develops without harming nature or any of the species living within the existing forest.

The space visibility area of Vertia is low thanks to its colour design choices providing passive camouflage, however, its ceiling is exposed and its shields can be detected with certain technologies.

### Long-distance transport
Vertia is directly connected to several suboceanic cities deeper into [[Lumia]] and to its neighbour land city, Terrene, via the [[Hybrid Novan Rail Network]] (HNRN). Citizens travelling through the [[Novan Rail Network]] (NRN) need to change to the HNRN as the latter is better suited for underwater operations.

## Notable landscapes
Vertia is home to Novans' favourite suboceanic landscapes, with many of them visiting the city at least once in their lives.

## Defences
Vertia features an always-on soft shield designed to not harm the wildlife, but it has two back-up hard layers that enable when the previous is damaged or malfunctioning, the last being the strongest.

The primary shield also comes with a vibrating system that keeps wildlife from interacting with the city's shields.

Like other suboceanic cities in Nova, the probability of an enemy attack is very low due to a combination of factors, including their low visibility and low strategical importance, therefore the city does not have automatic defences such as turrets.
