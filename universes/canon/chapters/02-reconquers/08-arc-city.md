# Arc City

	"General!" Shouted Crysrel, "the scout team has arrived the city, and they bring terrible news!"
	"Bring them to me," replied calmly.
	"I am here, general!" shouted the scout leader, "I bring terrible news!" Continued.
	"What is it? Were you able to find allies?"
	"No, Kal-71 has captured all our ally cities within the radius of 10 kilometres, as far as we are concerned, we are surrounded by enemies".
	"Are their defensive structures still operational?"
	"Yes, and not only that, we have evidence that they have also reinforced them."
	"That is indeed the last thing I wanted to hear, but I cannot sit still." The general answered worryingly, "Crysrel, please come to my war office." The general ordered via radio.
	"On my way, sir," answered Crysrel.

Arc City's days were counted as it was the last city standing that was still opposing Kal-71's attacks, however, their
leaders and their warriors were not giving up, but their resistance would not last forever, as food and resources were
getting harder and harder to get.

The general, named Arthur, was Crysrel's father, and was originally born on Earth, then moved to Nova after his military
training in the Air Forces.

	"Did you call me, general?" Asked Crysrel.
	"Yes, please take a seat." Replied Arthur, "what do you think of our people's morale?"
