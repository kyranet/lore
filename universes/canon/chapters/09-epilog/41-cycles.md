Right after Sneeya sacrificed herself, the spatial breach destabilized and caused an explosion of unmeasurable energy
that caused space to compress very rapidly towards Sneeya's remains, taking all the Kal-71 units with it and fusing
all matter into a singularity that will eventually explode.

When Sneeya died, her mark and some of her memories were recorded into the Sxiry's blade.

The singularity reaches a critical threshold and expands rapidly, increasing the temperature of the universe. The first
light came out within the first three minutes, but it was too hot to shine. 380,000 years later, matter cooled and
started to form coherence - the universe was for first time, transparent. 400 million years later, the re-ionization
started, clumps of gas appeared, and some collapsed, creating the very first stars and galaxies.

Approximately 9 billion years after Sneeya's sacrifice, the Sun was born, alongside 100 billion more stars in Milky Way.
Life started to appear in the Sun's solar system, specifically in the third planet, after half a billion years. 4
billion years later, in the same planet, Evangelyn Easton would be born in a small town in Canada, and would get
forcibly abducted to a place where she would learn to become a leader - but without any doubt, she was destined to
become the holder of the Sxiry.
