# The Beginning

"Test number 12; initializing service robots," announced the operator from the Vortax 04 Scientific Facility, "let's
see if those robots respond to the new programming."

Minutes after, right after the operator gave up all hope, one of the three robots, code-named Alpha 04, started moving
its arms, followed by the other two robots seconds after, code-named Alpha 06 and Alpha 07. The operator, named Val,
got excited and immediately called his superiors regarding the experiment's success.

	"You did a great job, Val, are they ready for deployment?" Asked the superiors.
	"Not really," replied Val, "right now their software is generic, but we have the first working version, which will serve as the base for the next versions."
	"I hope you finish that work soon; we are on a tight schedule, and we need them as soon as possible."
	"Sure thing! I think I will have the first robot ready within the following two days."
	"Who am I?" Abruptly interrupted Alpha 04.
	"Geez!" exclaimed Val as he got scared, "I will shut you down now, see you later!"
	"Why-y-y..."
	"You have until tomorrow night to get the first one done, please report to me when it's ready", said the superior.
	"Understood!"

All three bots went into sleep mode, and Val started preparing Alpha 04 for its dedicated programming.
