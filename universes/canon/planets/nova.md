# Nova

Nova is an artificial located at **Sector 00**, and is the central planet for [ArchId]. The capital is set as
[Arc City][ArcCity] and is a mostly hollow planet with an artificial multi-dimensional core with an approximate
diameter of 71,500 kilometres.

The surface of the planet includes a biosphere similar to Earth's, which made it very suitable for humans (original
inhabitants of Nova), although it did not have a breathable atmosphere during its construction until it had a radius of
was 35,000 kilometres, and was built by adding additional layers and moving the biosphere to the upper layers. The
gravity in the surface has an acceleration of 9.781 m/sÂ² and has an atmospheric pressure at sea level of 1021.85
millibars. A day in this planet consists of 26 hours 12 minutes.

Within the solar system, Nova has two moons ([Klyn] and [Luna]) and is the only planet in the system after [Kal-71]
changed the orbit of the three outer planets to make them move outside the system with the intention of removing the
natural astronomical defences against comets and meteors to make the Nova more vulnerable.

Due to [Kal-71]'s relentless attacks against the planet, Nova is the most militarized planet and has made the
construction of city defences mandatory, the most common defences being the [Executioner Tower][Executioner] and the
[Sniper Cannon][Sniper]. However, due to their extreme range, only 2-4 are built per city. The exception is
[Arc City][ArcCity], which has 6 [Hexa 5][Hexagon]s, 8 [Sniper Tower][Sniper]s, 16 [Sniper Cannon][Sniper]s, 32
[Executioner Towers][Executioner], the [Cyan Tower][CyanTower], and more. For the citizen's comfort, all defences are
either hidden underground or concealed within the buildings.

Nova is also home of the [ArchId Ring][ArchIdRing], which is the most powerful processing computer ever created.
