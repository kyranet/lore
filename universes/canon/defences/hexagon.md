# Hexagon (ArchId)

Hexagons are very heavily defensive military training structures with an hexagonal shape that can train up to 150,000
military units in all kinds of combats. The units are often composed of [NEÎ¼BOT][NeuBOT]-powered androids who get
enhanced based on their ranks (due to the rarity of the materials used in elite units). Those enhancements are unique
per unit and are granted based on their specific skills.

The hexagon's size is not always the same, and varies based on the population of the nearest city, however, its defence
modules are typically the same within the same generation. The most common one is **Hexa 4**, which comes with 18
[Executioner Turrets][Executioner] on the roof and 6 [Sniper Cannons][Sniper] on the edges.

**Hexa 5** exists only in [Arc City][ArcCity] due to the rarity of its materials, and its defences consist exclusively
of 12 [Ballista Towers][Ballista] on the roof and 6 [Executioner Cannons][Executioner] on the edges.
