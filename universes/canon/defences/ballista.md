# Ballista (ArchId)

Ballista is a very rare class of weapons and are typically used in [Ballista-class] warships. They are phased energy
weapons that can disrupt shield systems, cause short-circuits in electric systems, and quickly melt most alloys. This
weapon comes in three different categories:

- **Turret**: the smallest of all, it is a small turret which muzzle is around 40 to 50 metres.
- **Tower**: similar to turrets, but they have a taller body and a longer muzzle, typically around 100 and 200 metres.
- **Cannon**: their body is small and very heavily reinforced, cannons are often attached to the warship, and may or may
not be able to rotate.

The first appearance of this class happens very late in the story, and is the predecessor of the more powerful [Naeria].
