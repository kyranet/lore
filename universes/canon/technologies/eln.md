# ELN Shielding

ELN is a standard classification for very-dense energy-based shields and determines how much protection they provide. It is
important to note that the ELN standard does **not** take into account how long shields last, only what it is able to
protect from given that it does not run out of energy.

For a shielding system to fall into this classification, it must provide protection the level of `ELN-01` or higher, and
must be effective against both energy and physical attacks.

- `ELN-01`: Can protect a ship's hull integrity from the gravitational pull of a black hole.
- `ELN-04`: Can protect a ship from being destroyed by the collision of two planets.
- `ELN-X0`: Can protect a ship from being disintegrated by the explosion of a supernova.
