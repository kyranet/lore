# Absortion Shield

An Absortion Shield is a special shield that redirects all energy, even harmful radiation, to the energy core of its
user. It is typically never used for longer than a second as a quick enemy can take the user down in little time.

There are exceptions to this rule, such as the [Bow Project][BowProject], which redirects the energy to the bow instead
of the user, which can be transformed for energy amplification.

Unlike [ELN] shields, Absortion ones are typically not protective and cannot always prevent damage to the user. However,
it is efficient against energy-dense projectiles.
