# ArchId Alert Levels

[ArchId] classifies alert levels by color as it follows:

- **Green Alert**: Low priority, nearby units can handle the situation but reinforcements are not required.
- **Blue Alert**: Low priority, nearby units can handle the situation but reinforcements are likely to be required.
- **Yellow Alert**: Medium priority, high-ranked units are at significant risk, all ready reinforcements will be called
within the quadrant.
- **Red Alert**: High priority, a colony is at significant risk, all reinforcements will be called within the quadrant
and with permission to use experimental drives.
- **Black Alert**: Maximum priority, an [Archivist] or a [Librarian] is at significant risk, all units will be called
within the quadrant and neighbours, with the requirement to overcharging each unit to Factor 180, enabling
state-of-the-art weapons and destroy on sight upon arriving.
- **Purple Alert**: Maximum priority, **Sector 0A** or [Teryl] is at potential danger, all units from the entire galaxy
and neighbours will stop doing what they are doing and must arrive there with their fastest drives no matter core and
backup drains, each unit is required to overcharge itself to Factor 640 (Factor 8,500,000 for High-Ranked, such as
[Skyra]), enabling anti-planetary royal-state weapons if available, and anniquilate all threat on sight upon arriving.
