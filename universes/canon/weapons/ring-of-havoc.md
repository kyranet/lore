# Ring of Havoc

The sixth stage of the [Bow Project][BowProject], consists of the predecessor with a ring that surrounds the user
perpendicularly in relation to the weapon. Said ring is used to increase the strength of the link between the weapon and
the user, draining nearly unmeasurable levels of energy. Energy is transferred via a new technology this stage adds,
called [Hyperspace Energy Packing][HyperspaceEnergyPacking].

The energy requirement is increased by 9700% and cannot be used (in theory) within the [Canon Universe][CanonUniverse],
as the most powerful character, [HOC][HyperOverCharge]-enabled [Skyra] cannot survive to even create it.

Evolves from [Pentagon of Lawlessness][PentagonOfLawlessness] and evolves into [Universe of Disruption][UniverseOfDisruption].
