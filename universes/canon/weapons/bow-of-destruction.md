# Bow Of Destruction

The fourth stage of the [Bow Project][BowProject] and the most powerful one used in the [Canon Universe][CanonUniverse],
which completely destroyed [Skyra]'s [heart][NovaHeart], rendering her unoperative for 100 years. The Bow consists of
four pillars and enables an extra technology to aid with the energy accumulation: [Pure Energy Transfer][PureEnergyTransfer].

This is also the first stage in which energy is not only in the pillars themselves, but also spread similarly to plasma,
between the pillars and the user. The size is increased by 30% compared to the antecessor and yields 140% more energy,
becoming a deadly weapon, both for the targets and for the user itself.

The radiation emitted at this stage is deadly for any organic living being and is intense enough to quickly melt
tungsten at one kilometre away.

Evolves from [Pyramid of Mayhem][PyramidOfMayhem] and evolves into [Pentagon of Lawlessness][PentagonOfLawlessness].
