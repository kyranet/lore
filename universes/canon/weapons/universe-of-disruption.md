# Universe of Disruption

The seventh and last stage of the [Bow Project][BowProject], consists of a full sphere that can only be used by entities
able to use near-limitless amounts of energy that also have a [ELN]-X0 for protection. This is also the only stage
that cannot be shot upon created, but rather needs to drain all of the user's energy to total depletion. Because its
energy is similar to that of multiple supernovas, the stability is achieved by storing and transferring energy across
multiple dimensions, also called [Cross-Dimensional Energy Transfer][CrossDimensionalEnergyTransfer].

While this is not mentioned in the [Canon Universe][CanonUniverse], it is the continuation of the [Bow Project][BowProject],
as per the [Lynarch Universe][LynarchUniverse]'s events.

A quirk of this stage is that it always kills the user, regardless of its shields.

Evolves from [Ring of Havoc][RingOfHavoc].
