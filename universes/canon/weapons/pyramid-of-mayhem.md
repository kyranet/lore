# Pyramid of Mayhem

The third stage of the [Bow Project][BowProject], it consists of three pillars with four layers each and unlike the
predecessor, it is the first stage that is not straight (perpendicular to the weapon's direction) and creates a frontal
[absorption shield][AbsortionShield] which is used for both collecting energy from enemy attacks and to add a new type
of attack.

When the Pyramid is activated, the user has the choice of whether they want to use an arrow (very concentrated
projectile), or use the [absorption shield][AbsortionShield] to create a more spread attack which can disable all
systems in front of it with an angle of 35 degrees from the center.

This is also the first stage that emits radiation, as the energy levels become too high for the weapon to keep hold of.
This can be resolved with a more powerful shield, but doing so enormously increases the energy demands and can lead to
the reduction of the energy levels required for the Pyramid to be stable.

Evolves from [Pillar of Disorder][PillarOfDisorder] and evolves into [Bow of Destruction][BowOfDestruction].
