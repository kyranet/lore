# Pentagon of Lawlessness

The fifth stage of the [Bow Project][BowProject], consists of five pillars split in three parts each and has a size 15%
larger than the predecessor. This stage adds [Graviton Energy][GravitonEnergy], a technology that could theoretically
disrupt, and even completely destroy, any high-density energy conduit. The [absorption shield][AbsortionShield]'s size
is increased by 250%, covering the 90% of the pillars.

The energy requirement is increased by 1150% and distorts space itself to increase the amount of energy that can be
stored.

Evolves from [Bow of Destruction][BowOfDestruction] and evolves into [Ring of Havoc][RingOfHavoc].
