# ArchId

ArchId comes from "Architectural Identifier" and is the main faction in the lore, as the stories focus on its characters.
This faction is ally with [RedLan] and enemy with [Kal-71] and has its capital in [Nova].

The political system consists of a moderated anarchy with decentralized government based on proposals made and voted by
its citizens, where the votes are casted on-line anywhere in the cities, and then a spokesperson announces the results.
It is not unknown that ArchId has very specific laws against [anti-competitive practices][ACP],
[planned obsolescense][PO], lack of [Transparency], and other similar practices. Distributing [proprietary software][PS]
is also considered illegal in many regulations, as it makes harder for security researchers to identify security issues
within the shared network, which can lead to vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive information to malicious users.

The economy is based on merit, ArchId does not recognize any kind of currency as something useful, but rather a waste
of energy and resources that could be used for other purposes, such as using the raw materials for building utilities
the citizens need or even repairing existing products. As such, a system of physical workshops is created to keep the
society working as a whole, often creating competition with other workshops of the same services, and as such, evolving
and creating better products.

The education system is universal and free for everyone regardless of species, age, gender, or race. There are no rules
set on stone, but rather guidelines and recommendations for educators to follow. The common course of learning for a
human citizen is to start their lessons at age of 4 and finish at age of 16 years. After which, they look for a workshop
of the kind they are interested in, and apply as an apprentice of the workshop's master, who will then transfer their
techniques and culture to the next generation of workers.

ArchId also globally identifies a system called **Set of Objectives**, which is a set of three guidelines everyone
should follow in order for the community to prosper:

1. *Do what you're the best on* - no matter what you want to do, you are welcome to come with a plan for your future and
we as a society will help you in the way.
1. *Coordinate with your fellows* - there is always somebody willing to help if you need anything, we work better
together, you can count on them!
1. *Relax your thoughts* - we encourage everyone to take personal time to meet their friends, family, or even visit
and/or make new friends, you are free to roam around in ArchId's territories.

ArchId's commitment to the preservation of nature has caused the architecture of the cities to follow a very strict set
of guidelines that align with the ones of [Solarpunk].

There are also a series of groups of agents of different classes that play different roles in the preservation of the
galaxy as it is known, for example, ArchId has a concept of "sectors" which indicate a solar system or a group of
planets, and assigns an [Archivist-class][Archivist] unit to study and preserve its information.
